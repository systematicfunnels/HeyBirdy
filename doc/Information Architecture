Below is a **clear, build-ready Information Architecture (IA)** for **HeyBirdy**, designed specifically for:

* **first-time users**
* **simple auth**
* **progressive role activation**
* **one identity, many capabilities**
* **community-driven growth**

This explains **what exists, where it lives, and why**, without over-engineering.

## 🗂️ Information Architecture (IA) — HeyBirdy

> **Core IA Principle**
> Users don’t navigate “modules”.
> They move through **content → actions → outcomes**.

---

## 1️⃣ Top-Level IA (What exists at the highest level)

HeyBirdy has **ONE primary surface** after login:

```
Home (Discovery Feed)
```

Everything else is **contextual**, not forced.

### Why this matters

* Matches social platforms
* Reduces cognitive load
* Encourages exploration before commitment

---

## 2️⃣ Global Structure (Always Available)

These elements are **always accessible**, regardless of capability.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Top Bar                            │
│ - Logo                             │
│ - Search                           │
│ - Notifications                    │
│ - Profile                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Profile (single identity)

Contains:

* Public profile
* Capabilities (Member / Affiliate / Creator)
* Earnings
* Settings

⚠️ No role switching
Capabilities appear automatically.

---

## 3️⃣ Primary Navigation (Flow-Based, Not Role-Based)

Instead of role dashboards, HeyBirdy uses **Flows**.

### Flow Switcher (Left / Bottom Nav)

```
• Discover
• Create
• Share & Earn
• Community
• Insights
```

> These flows exist for **everyone**
> Visibility adapts based on capability

---
