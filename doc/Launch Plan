---

4. Retain creators without paid ads

## 2️⃣ Launch Phases Overview

| Phase   | Name                | Duration  | Goal                      |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Phase 0 | Private Alpha       | 2–3 weeks | Kill bugs, test core loop |
| Phase 1 | Creator-Led Beta    | 4 weeks   | Validate growth flywheel  |
| Phase 2 | Community Expansion | 4–6 weeks | Prove viral spread        |
| Phase 3 | Public Launch       | Ongoing   | Scale carefully           |

---

## 🟢 Phase 0: Private Alpha (Invite-Only)

### 🎯 Goal

Ensure the **core loop works end-to-end**:

> Watch → Share → Earn → Repeat

### Who to invite (VERY IMPORTANT)

* 10–20 creators you already know
* Each with **1k–50k audience**
* Highly engaged niche creators

❌ Do NOT invite random users
❌ Do NOT do paid ads

---

### What features MUST work

* Simple signup
* Content playback
* Share & Earn
* Affiliate tracking
* Earnings visibility

Nothing else matters yet.

---

### Alpha success checklist

* At least 1 affiliate earns money
* At least 1 creator gets affiliate-driven sale
* No confusion about “what to do next”

If this fails → **do not launch**.

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: Creator-Led Beta (Soft Launch)

### 🎯 Goal

Let creators **bring their communities**.

### Who joins

* 50–100 creators
* Each invited personally
* Focus on:

  * education
  * marketing
  * tech
  * fitness
  * niche skills

---

### Launch Strategy

Creators announce HeyBirdy to their audience as:

> “A new way to support me and earn together”

This framing is critical.

---

### What users experience

* Content first
* Share & Earn naturally
* No pressure to create accounts

---

### Metrics to watch (daily)

| Metric                        | Target         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Time to first share           | < 10 min       |
| % users clicking Share & Earn | ≥ 20%          |
| % users earning at least once | ≥ 5%           |
| Creator affiliate revenue     | ≥ 25% of sales |

---

### Feedback loops

* Daily creator WhatsApp/Slack group
* 1-click in-app feedback
* Founder personally talks to creators

---

## 🟡 Phase 2: Community Expansion

### 🎯 Goal

Test **viral coefficient** and retention.

### What changes

* Open signups
* Light referral nudges
* Highlight earnings publicly (opt-in)

---

### Growth lever

**Affiliate-driven invites**, not ads.

Examples:

* “Earn by sharing” banners
* Weekly top earner highlights
* Creator shoutouts for affiliates

---

### Key experiment

> Can users invite users *without* creators pushing every time?

If yes → product-market fit signal.

---

### Metrics

| Metric            | Healthy Signal |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Viral coefficient | ≥ 0.4          |
| DAU/MAU           | ≥ 25%          |
| Repeat sharing    | ≥ 40%          |
| 7-day retention   | ≥ 30%          |

---

## 🔵 Phase 3: Public Launch

### 🎯 Goal

Scale without breaking trust or UX.

### Launch actions

* Product Hunt (only if loop is strong)
* Creator testimonials
* Case studies (“Fan earned ₹X”)
* Community success stories

---

### What NOT to do

❌ Heavy ads
❌ Feature explosion
❌ Enterprise pitches

---

## 3️⃣ Go-To-Market Messaging (CRITICAL)

### For Creators

> “Your community can now grow you — and earn with you.”

### For Fans

> “Earn by supporting creators you already love.”

### For Affiliates

> “No approval. No complexity. Just share & earn.”

---

## 4️⃣ Onboarding at Launch (Non-Negotiable)

### First 5 minutes must show:

1. Valuable content
2. Share & Earn button
3. Clear reward explanation
4. Zero role confusion

If this fails → churn spikes.
