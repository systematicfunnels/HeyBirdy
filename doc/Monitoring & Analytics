# 📊 Monitoring & Analytics — HeyBirdy

## Guiding Principle

> **If you can’t see the first earning moment clearly,
> you can’t fix growth.**

Analytics at HeyBirdy exist to:

* protect user trust
* validate the growth flywheel
* prevent silent failure
* guide product decisions

---

## 1️⃣ Analytics Architecture (How Data Flows)

### Data Flow (Simple & Safe)

```
User Action
→ Event Emitted
→ Event Store
→ Analytics Processor
→ Dashboards + Alerts
```

### Tools (Recommended)

* **Product analytics:** PostHog / Mixpanel
* **System monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana
* **Logs:** Loki / Datadog
* **Error tracking:** Sentry
* **Business metrics:** Custom DB views

❗ Never block user actions on analytics writes
❗ Analytics failures must not affect UX

---

## 2️⃣ Event Tracking Model (Core of Everything)

### Canonical Event Schema

```json
{
  "event": "event_name",
  "userId": "u_123",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "properties": {
    "contentId": "c_123",
    "amount": 250,
    "source": "share_earn"
  }
}
```

### Event Rules

1. Events are **append-only**
2. No updates, no deletes
3. Same event name everywhere
4. Events drive rewards, not UI actions

---

## 3️⃣ Critical Product Events (MUST TRACK)

### Identity & Entry

* `signup_completed`
* `first_content_viewed`

### Engagement

## 4️⃣ North-Star Metrics (Non-Negotiable)

### 🎯 Primary North Star

**% of users who reach first earning**

This proves:

* incentive alignment
* community participation
* product differentiation

---

### Supporting North Stars

| Metric                      | Why it matters             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Time to first share         | Measures clarity           |
| Time to first earning       | Measures motivation        |
| % affiliate activation      | Measures intent            |
| % creator affiliate revenue | Measures flywheel strength |

---

## 5️⃣ Funnel Analytics (Real Behavior)

→ Earning
```

Track **drop-offs at every step**.

### Healthy Benchmarks (Early-Stage)

* Share click rate ≥ 20%

* Repeat sharing ≥ 40%

---

## 6️⃣ Persona-Based Analytics

### Creator Metrics

---

## 7️⃣ Retention & Cohort Analysis

### Cohorts to Track

* Day-0 signup cohorts
* First earning cohorts
* Creator activation cohorts

### Key Retention Questions

* Do earners come back more?
* Do affiliates become creators?
* Does community activity predict retention?

If yes → double down
If no → fix incentives

---

## 8️⃣ Revenue & Unit Economics Monitoring

* Platform take rate

---

## 9️⃣ System Monitoring (Trust Layer)

### What MUST be monitored 24/7

#### Infrastructure

* API latency (p95 < 200ms)
* Error rate (< 1%)
* Queue lag (event bus)
* DB connection saturation

#### Payments

* Checkout failures
* Payout job failures
* Commission mismatches

#### Tracking

* Affiliate link click loss
* Conversion attribution gaps

---

## 🔔 10️⃣ Alerts & Intervention Rules

### Product Alerts

* No `first_earning` events in 24h → 🚨
* Share clicks drop > 30% WoW → ⚠️
* Creator affiliate revenue < 20% → ⚠️

### System Alerts

* Payment failures > threshold
* Event lag > X seconds
* Spike in failed link redirects

Alerts must trigger **human review**, not just logs.

---

## 11️⃣ Dashboards (Who Sees What)

### Founder Dashboard (Daily)

* First earnings count
* Viral coefficient
* Creator affiliate revenue %
* DAU / WAU

### Product Team

* Funnel conversion
* Feature adoption
* Drop-off analysis

### Engineering

* Latency

* Queue health

---

## 12️⃣ Privacy & Ethics (Critical)

* No dark tracking
* No selling user data
* Clear earnings transparency
* GDPR-compliant deletion
* Opt-out analytics where required

Trust is part of analytics.

---

## 13️⃣ What NOT to Track (Early)

❌ Page views as success
❌ Raw MAU without context
❌ Feature clicks without outcomes
❌ Vanity leaderboard metrics

---

## 🧠 Final Monitoring Philosophy (Lock This)

> **If analytics don’t help a user earn,
> retain, or trust the platform —
> they are noise.**

HeyBirdy measures **participation**, not popularity.
