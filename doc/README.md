## 🛠️ Core Principles
1. **Simple Auth First**: No role selection at signup.
2. **Progressive Capability Unlock**: Roles (Creator, Affiliate) are unlocked through actions, not settings.
3. **One Identity**: A single user account can be a fan, a creator, and an affiliate simultaneously.
4. **Community-Driven Growth**: Incentivizing sharing and participation to create a viral loop.
