Below is a **practical, build-ready Wireframes & Prototypes blueprint** for **HeyBirdy**, written so:

* a **first-time user journey is obvious**
* **designers know what to draw**
* **engineers know what to build**
* **nothing breaks the progressive-role logic**

This is **low-fidelity by intention** (wireframes first, visuals later).

# 🧩 Wireframes & Prototypes — HeyBirdy

> **Wireframe principle**
> If a screen cannot explain **what to do next in 3 seconds**, it is wrong.

---

## 1️⃣ Wireframe System Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Before screens, lock these rules:

1. **Content first, always**
2. **No role selection screens**
3. **Actions unlock capabilities**
4. **One screen = one main action**
5. **Rewards visible on every major screen**

---

## 2️⃣ Global Layout (Applies to ALL Screens)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Logo | Search | 🔔 | Profile              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          │
│              MAIN CONTENT                │
│                                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Discover | Create | Share & Earn | Community │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

* Top bar = identity & awareness
* Bottom/side nav = **flows**, not roles
* Center = **content or action**

### Critical micro-interaction

When user taps **Share & Earn** for first time:

```
Modal (inline, light):

"You can earn by sharing this.
Turn it on in 30 seconds."

[ Enable & Get Link ]
```

No dashboard redirect.
No new page.

## 12️⃣ Prototype Flow Summary (Clickable Logic)

### Day-1 Prototype Path

```
Signup
→ Discover
→ Watch content
→ Share & Earn
→ First earning
```

### Day-7 Prototype Path

```
Discover
→ Affiliate earnings
→ Community
→ Post content
→ Creator unlock
```

---

## 13️⃣ What NOT to Prototype Early (Important)

❌ Advanced analytics
❌ Settings-heavy screens
❌ Role dashboards
❌ Empty states without guidance

Focus on:

* first value
* first share
* first earning

---

## 14️⃣ Wireframe Validation Checklist

Every wireframe must answer:

1. What can I do here?
2. Why should I do it?
3. What do I get if I do it?
4. What happens next?

If any answer is unclear → redesign.

---

## 🧠 Final Wireframe Philosophy (Lock This)

> **HeyBirdy wireframes should feel like a social app first —
> and a business platform only after success.**

That’s what keeps first-time users alive.

### 🔜 Next (Recommended)

I can:

* Turn this into **Figma page structure**
* Create **mobile-first wireframes**
* Write **exact UI copy for each screen**
* Define **prototype success metrics**
* Do a **UX teardown simulation**

Tell me what you want next 👍
